NYC MTA Transit Dashboard: MetroCard vs OMNY Analysis (2020–2024)

In this project, I analyzed over two million (2700000) MTA transit records to explore trends in fare payment methods, fare class usage, and geographic ridership distribution across New York City.

Key Focus:
-Comparing **MetroCard** and **OMNY** adoption over time by fare class and borough.

Interactive Dashboard:

Raw Data:
-https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Subway-Hourly-Ridership-2020-2024/wujg-7c2s/about_data

Project Objectives:
-Compared MetroCard vs OMNY usage from 2020 - 2024 (OMNY first implemented in May 2020)
-Explore different fare class categories (Full Fare, Students, Seniors, etc)
-Analyze ridership by NYC borough
-Created an Interactive Panel so hidden data can be seen better, such as Staten Island was crushed in the Seaborn visualization
-Visualize trends and insights (findings) with the interactive Tableau Dashboard

Tools Used:
- **Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, panel, datetime)** – for data cleaning and prep
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Tableau** – for interactive dashboard development and visualization **Tableau Public**

-**Key Findings from the NYC MTA Ridership Analysis (2019–2024):**
-
-Since implementing the OMNY payment method, OMNY usage has increased from 536K riders in 2020 to over 12.7M in 2024, showing widespread adoption of the contactless fare payment method.
-By 2024, OMNY nearly equaled and overtook MetroCard in total ridership, marking a turning point in rider behavior towards the OMNY contactless payment method.
-MetroCard ridership peaked in 2022 (16.8M) and has since declined to 11.1M in 2024, reflecting the gradual decrease of MetroCard fare systems.
-Discounted fare categories (e.g., Seniors, Students, Fair Fare) are still more heavily used via MetroCard, suggesting a lag in OMNY accessibility for these groups.

-**Pandemic effect:**
-Ridership dropped in 2020 due to COVID-19, but in 2021 usage increased rapidly.
