NYC MTA Transit Dashboard: MetroCard vs OMNY Analysis (2020–2024)

In this project, I analyzed over two million (2700000) MTA transit records to explore trends in fare payment methods, fare class usage, and geographic ridership distribution across New York City.

Key Focus:
-Comparing **MetroCard** and **OMNY** adoption over time by fare class and borough.

Project Objectives:
-Compared MetroCard vs OMNY usage from 2020 - 2024 (OMNY first implemented in May 2020)
-Explore different fare class categories (Full Fare, Students, Seniors, etc)
-Analyze ridership by NYC borough
-Created an Interactive Panel so hidden data can be seen better, such as Staten Island was crushed in the Seaborn visualization
-Visualize trends and insights (findings) with the interactive Tableau Dashboard

Tools Used:
- **Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, panel, datetime)** – for data cleaning and prep
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Tableau** – for interactive dashboard development and visualization **Tableau Public**
